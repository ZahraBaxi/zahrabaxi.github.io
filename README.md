- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zahra!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Human Centered Design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS

I have been working on creating my website through HTML for many years. This is where I store my HTML files for my website. While this site is still a work in progress, you can see my site at <a href="https://www.zahrabaxi.com"> www.zahrabaxi.com </a> (which currently uses Google Sites until I complete my HTML site)
