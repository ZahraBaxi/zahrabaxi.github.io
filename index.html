<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h2> I am Zahra, a UC Berkeley student with a passion for <br> <i> <u>human-centered design</u></i> and all things creative.</h2>

<p> I am currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley originally from Davis, California.
  I am studying Cognitive Science and Art and am working on completing the Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation. 
  When I am taking a break from my courses or participating in clubs on campus I like to draw and take photographs. </p>
<p> Other things I am interested in are skateboarding, roller hockey, techwear fashion, and I am currently trying to read the entire Dune series.</p>
